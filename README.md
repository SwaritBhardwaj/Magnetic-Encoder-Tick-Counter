# Magnetic-Encoder-Tick-Counter
This code will help to determine the total pulse counts/ticks in a rotation of an optical or rotatory encoder.
This is an Arduino based program. Iif one can not find the datasheet of the encoder, it becomes hard to determine the pulse per reolution which is needed to calculate rpm of the actuator. Here one can manually rotate the shaft to one rotation and can determine the ticks in one rotation.
Values will be displayed on the serial monitor.
